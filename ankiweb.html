Status: unfinished. Released so that I can share with others to find bugs. Unless you can find out if it works or not don't download this add-on. Make sure to have working backups and know how to restore them. That's a great idea in general and especially if you want to try out a newly released add-on that changes due dates and that doesn't have many upvotes ... Use it at your own risk.


This add-on adds a context menu to the Add button which is in the lower left corner of the Add window. You can change the due number for the cards of the note you just created or you can bury those cards.

This might be useful if you add several cards that ask about the same topic in different ways and you don't want to see them at the same time. You could quickly reschedule them when you see them the first time in the reviewer (with ReMemorize/QuickReschedule or MoreButtonsForNewCards) but when I only reschedule later during a review I will have forgotten which cards need to be rescheduled ... 

You can adjust some settings in the add-on dialog and also have the option to reschedule cards shown. This is not intended for regular use since this graduates cards and pressing again "Again" on such review cards reduces their ease which might put you into "ease hell" in the long run. Maybe relevant if you know the card is very easy - but in this case you could just use the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/153603893" rel="nofollow">More Answer Buttons for New Cards</a> (a version for 2.1 is available <a href="https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/releases/tag/0.1.0-temp" rel="nofollow">here</a>) or with lovac42's <a href="https://github.com/lovac42/ReMemorizeButtons" rel="nofollow">ReMemorizeButtons</a>.

<b>other add-ons</b>
If you want all new cards to be shown only after n days use lovac42's

<b>Limitations, Incompatibilities</b>
- Todo: Add Icons to the context menu.
- This add-on doesn't work with <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1032766035" rel="nofollow">Pennywise: Add Only Once Option</a>.

<b># bugs etc.</b>
Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know on <a href="" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord). Maybe I'll have an idea.
